    <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes">Dots and Squares game</a></h1>
    <p>Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single 
        horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player 
        who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another 
        turn. (A point is recorded by placing a "A" or "B" identifying the player in 
        the box) The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player 
        with the most points. This game uses 10X10 dots.</p>
